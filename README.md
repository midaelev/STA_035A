These files are the R codes (maybe sometimes they won't be codes) I had for my statistics courses.
For HW 1, I learnt the basic structure and codes in R, such as how to create vectors and dataframes or how to extract data from lists.
Also, I got to know some codes and rules that would probably appear in lots of the codings, such as filtering and looping.

For HW 2, I used several library such as dplyr and dslabs. Those librarys allow me to view dataframes and to filter out data easily, such as using pipe %>%.
The codes that I got most impression were codes in checking dataframes, such as str(), filter(), select(), mutate(), summarize(), etc. 
With these functions, it's easier to evaluate data.

Then, I learnt to use ggplot to make visualizations of data in boxplot, scatter points, line graph, etc. It provides me flexible approaches to show the data.

The fourth assignment didn't need to write codes, but I leant the basic knowledge of probability and different theories and formulas to calculate different probabilities.

I practiced what different probability models were and how to calculate them in HW5. There are several formulas, and those simbols are hard to remember. But as long as I figured out the inside logic, probability becomes more friendly.

I am learning probability recently, and the 6th assignments are all about deciding what type of distribution it is, like Bernoulli, binomial or normal, and using Z or T distribution/index. These concepts are also very basic in stats learning.

The 7th assignmnet is about null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis, and it asks us to compare the p-value to the significance level and to see whether the evidence is enough for supporting the claim.
